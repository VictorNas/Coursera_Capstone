In total, there are internationally recognised sovereign states in Europe. However, since The Vatican City is actually located inside the city of Rome, which is other European capital, the Vatican city was excluded of this analysis.\n",
    "After collecting all the relevant information from the wikipedia page, the Nominatim library was used to get the Latitude and Longitude for each European Capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) was used to collect a large number of venues for each capital. It was collected almost 700 venues for each capital with a radius of 30000 meters from their respected Latitude and Longitude. The following data was collected for each venue: the name of the venue, its category, its latitude and its longitude. After these steps, all these information was store in a Dataframe with all the possible duplicates eliminated. In the end, 25332 venues of 489 categories was collected. The resulting Data Frame looks the image below, where each row represents a venue.\n",
